That is, we assume there is some state space $\\cal S$  over which a Markov process gives rise to *trajectories*, that is, sequences of states in $\\cal S$ of length $n$, $(s_i \\in {\\cal S})_{i=1}^n$, such that $$p(\\left(s_i \\in {\\cal S}\\right)_{i=0}^{n-1}) = p_0(s_0)\\prod_{i}T(s_{i}, s_{i+1}),$$\r\n",

        "In RecSim NG, we assume that the state space factors via ${\\cal S} = \\times_i S^i$, where the $S^i$'s are individual **components** of the state space. For example, each component might reflect the state of some actor, or some random variable in the recommender environment. Such a factorization of the state space allows us to specify the initial state and transition kernel in a factored way as well. To do so, we use the language of *Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBNs)*.\r\n",

The components $T^i$ of the transition kernel are termed *conditional probability densities* (CPDs) or sometimes *factors*.\r\n",

        "We have so far covered how to specify DBN components as RecSim variables and their dependencies, and how to run the resulting simulation in a RecSim runtime.\r\n",
        "RecSim variables are the \"assembly language\" of a RecSim model: they reflect the bare minimum information necessary to define a simulation. As such, the variable API leaves a lot of useful structure on the table. \r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "In an agent-based simulation, there are two common sources of structure that can be harnessed to make complex models easier to implement:\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "1.   **Parameter sharing/encapsulation:** An agent may have multiple behaviors such as \"choose,\" \"observe,\" \"update state\", etc. All of these behaviors might be influenced by a common set of parameters, such as the agent's preferences, its risk sensitivity, its overall satisfaction, etc. This fits the object-oriented paradigm in which the various behaviors are expressed as methods and the shared parameters are encapsulated properties of the object. (In fact, agent-based modeling is often used to justify object-oriented programming.) \r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "2.   **Behavioral generalization:** While every agent in a population is unique to some degree, not everything they do is idiosyncratic. In fact, most behavioral models tend to be expressed in terms of a population \"template\" that abstracts away the individuality into some small set of parameters. For example, a multinomial logit model for *user choice* (i.e., a model which specifies the probabilty with which a user selects a specific item from a slate of recommended items) posits that an agent will choose an item with probability proportional to:\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        " $$\\exp(\\operatorname{affinity model}(\\mathrm{agent\\ features}, \\mathrm{item\\ features})).$$ \r\n",
        "In this example, the agent features are personlized each agent. However, the affinity model and the choice distribution family (i.e., softmax) are common to the entire population. Templatized models of this from offer two critical beneifits: (a) they allow us to define large populations of agents very concisely; and (b) they make heavy use of the accelerated computation present on modern hardware (through, for example, highly parallel hardware architectures).\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "In RecSim, these two types of structure are harnessed through the ```Entity``` pattern. A RecSim ```Entity``` is a class that models the parameters and behaviors of an entire population of agents, making use of batched execution as much as possible. Let's illustrate this by implementing a RecSim version of Conway's *Game of Life*. The purpose of an ```Entity``` is to provide methods that update a RecSim variable(s). We call these **behaviors**.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "The Game of Life is defined as follows: \r\n",
        "* The game consists of some number of agents (cells), typically arranged in a rectangular grid. Each cell has one bit of state reflecting whether it's currently alive.\r\n",
        "* At any point in time $t$, a cell counts its living *neighbours* (i.e., the occupants of the 8 adjacent grid points). If the number of living neighbors is less than 2 or more than 3, then the cell dies (if it was alive) due to under/overpopulation (if it was dead, it remains dead). If the number of living neighbors is exactly 3, the cell is reborn if it was dead (and remains alive if it was living).\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "The Game of Life embodies the principle of behavioral generalization in a very strict way: the rules are *identical* for every cell, and the outcome of the state transition is determined by a small set of parameters---the state of a cell and the states of its neighbors. In fact, we can use this to our advantage. By representing the state of the entire cell population as a binary rank-2 tensor, we can implement the neighbor-counting operation as a 2-dimensional convolution with the following kernel:\r\n",
